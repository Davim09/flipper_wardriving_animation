# Flipper Zero Wardriving Animation
I made an animation of the flipper based on this antenna photo from @diegodartora_ on Instagram:

# How to do it 
First of all, take the "wardriving" folder and place it in the "dolphin" folder via qFlipper like this

After that, download the "manifest.txt" file and add the following text at the end of it:
```
Name: wardriving
Min butthurt: 0
Max butthurt: 30
Min level: 1
Max level: 30
Weight: 8
```
You can customize the levels at which the animation appears, and re-upload to the dolphin folder in flipper via qFlipper, After all the changes reboot your flipper, to find the animation press the "Ok button" on the flipper until it appears
