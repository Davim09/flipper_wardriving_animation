I made an animation of the flipper based on this antenna photo from @diegodartora_ on Instagram:

# How to do it 
First of all, take the "L1_Wardriving_128x64" folder and place it in the "dolphin" folder via qFlipper like this

After that, download the "manifest.txt" file and add the following text at the end of it:
```
Name: L1_Wardriving_128x64
Min butthurt: 0
Max butthurt: 14
Min level: 1
Max level: 30
Weight: 5
```
You can customize the levels at which the animation appears, So re-upload the "manifest.txt" to the dolphin folder in flipper via qFlipper and disable the battery icon! , After all the changes reboot your flipper, to find the animation press the "Ok button" on the flipper until it appears

#Remember

The "L1_Wardriving_128x64_png" folder is for you compile with the flipper firmware, it contains the .png of each frame, remeber to remove "_png" of the folder name to compile it
